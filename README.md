# Pixel Crusher

This is the first result of my challenge: to make games in a week. I select a successful, presumably simple, game and try to reimplement it as much as I can within a week. It was made in 6 days.

I'd be happy to receive any questions, comments, suggestions, or improvements on the code and the game itself, which will help me grow in game development.
